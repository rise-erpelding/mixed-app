          <p>First, enter the data for grouping students. At a minimum, you need to provide a student alias (such as a name, number, etc.) to identify the student. You may also add categories that you want to be taken into account when making groups--for example, student grades, personality types, learning styles, topics of interest--any value that you might want to use to categorize students.</p>
          <p>Put one value on each line. The order of the values MUST correspond to the order in which students are inputted. We recommend saving your categories on a spreadsheet and copying/pasting from a spreadsheet.</p>
