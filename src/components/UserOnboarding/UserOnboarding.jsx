          <p>First, enter the data for grouping students. At a minimum, you need to provide a student alias (such as a name, number, etc.) to identify the student. You  may also choose 2 categories for grouping.</p>
          <p>The two categories may be quantitative or qualitative. Quantitative categories must consist of a number for each student (for example, an assessment score), qualitative categories must consist of some string category for each student (you could pick book choices, personality types, learning styles, etc.).</p>
          <p>Put one value on each line. The order of the values MUST correspond to the order of the student aliases. We recommend saving your categories on a spreadsheet and copying/pasting from a spreadsheet.</p>
